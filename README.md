🏦 Decentralized Bank on Ethereum
Overview
This project implements a Decentralized Bank on Ethereum allowing:

✅ Staking – Earn rewards by staking your tokens securely.
✅ Lending & Borrowing – Supply and borrow assets with interest mechanisms.
✅ NFT Integration – Tokenize real-world assets and integrate them into lending/staking workflows.
✅ Auction House – Auction NFTs in a decentralized, transparent manner.
✅ Proxy Contracts – Upgradable architecture for production readiness.
✅ Foundry – Built using blazing-fast Foundry for testing, fuzzing, and deployment.

All contracts are audit-friendly, gas-optimized, and modular to support composability in DeFi ecosystems.

Tech Stack
Solidity (0.8.x) – Core smart contracts.

Foundry (Forge, Anvil, Cast) – Testing, local node, interaction.

OpenZeppelin – Security and reusable contract components.

Proxy Pattern – UUPS/Transparent for upgradability.

CI/CD (optional) – Suggested GitHub Actions for automatic tests on PR.

Features
✅ Stake to Earn – Users stake tokens and earn periodic rewards.
✅ Lending Pools – Supply and borrow against collateral with interest rate logic.
✅ NFT Collateral – Use NFTs as collateral in the lending system.
✅ Auction House – Bid, list, and settle NFT auctions transparently.
✅ Proxy Upgradability – Upgrade contract logic while maintaining state.
✅ Extensive Tests – Cover core logic with fuzz and invariant tests using Foundry.

🚀 Roadmap
 Core staking + reward system

 Lending & borrowing pools

 NFT minting and collateral support

 Auction house for NFTs

 Proxy-based upgradability

 Chainlink integration for price feeds

 Frontend dApp integration using wagmi/viem

🤝 Contributing
PRs and issues are welcome for gas optimizations, advanced collateral management, and Chainlink integrations.

🧪 Testing & Best Practices
Use forge test -vvv for verbose test output.

Write fuzz tests for deposit/withdraw and borrow/repay flows.

Use forge snapshot to monitor gas costs during PRs.

Consider using Slither and Mythril for static analysis before deployment.
